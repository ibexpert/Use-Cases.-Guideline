###Document Purpose

This document describes use-case modeling principles and may help project participants that are new to use a use-case driven approach to requirements management. It is simply a guide.

The goal of these guidelines is to provide project standards for the development and maintenance of requirements with use cases, and to ensure a consistent look and feel of all use-case related artifacts.
